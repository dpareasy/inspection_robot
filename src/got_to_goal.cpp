*Description:
*
*This node simulate the autonomous nvigation of a robt within the environment. It asks the user to insert a goal point.
*Once inserted the user can decide to cancel the actual goal or to exit the modality. If a goal point is already defined
*the user can't choose another unless he cancel it.
