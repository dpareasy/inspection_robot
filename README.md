## Introduction ##
This repository contains a ROS-based software, developed in python language, that implements the behavior of a surveillance robot. It represents an improvement of a previous work in which the simulation was handled with two scripts simulating the path of the robot through different random viapoints.
Here instead, the simulation is done with gazebo, and rviz is used as 3D visualizer.
For a detailed description of the architecture of the project visit the [first version](https://github.com/dpareasy/Assignment1) of the project.
